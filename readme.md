# Project CryptoBOT

A Cryptobot is a telegram bot that searches for a coin or token by its name or symbol. 
The user enters a coin name or coin symbol and receives in response the price of that coin in dollars, as well as its rise or fall over the last twenty-four hours. The user can also use the "TOP-5 Coins" button and get the prices of the top five coins. 
The button "Exchange Rate" shows the exchange rate of hryvnia in dollars, euros, pounds and zloty
